# SOOQ - a virtual marketplace
![snip 1]

The SOOQ website is a virtual marketplace where users can sign up to buy and sell items privatly from the comfort of their home.
It currently consists of three categories "Clothes", "Furniture" and "Toys". New categories as well as sub categories can be added as the demand increases.


## The SOOQ landing page- not signed in

Has a panel at the top with clickable buttons. 
These consist of options to "Sign in", "Browse" and "New items". The  SOOQ-name is also cxlickable and will redirect the user to the landing page. 

The first items visible are the "Newest items". These are found within a light grey section in a grid pattern consisting of three items per row. 
In the future, the grid will be restricted to 3 X 3 rows in order to keep the page user friendly. 

Under the "Newest items" the section consisting of the three categories is visible. 
As of now there are three categories but options for adding and removing will be implimented for the admin of the page.

At the bottom the section consiting of information such as "About" and a Menu consisting of clickable lilnks to "About", "Contact", "Privacy" and "Term of use".
The font is visible against the background and clickable links are coloured in a more vivid colour.


## How to use SOOQ as a new user

A new user can sign up to browse, list items for sale and contact other users to inquire about potential purchases.
The interface is very straightforward and simplistic in order to encourage the users to sign up and use the site.
As the new user arrives at the landing page, three options appear: signing up, signing in for existing users and browsing listed items without using/creating an account.
The new user will click "Sign up" and be redirected to a page asking for a valid username, and e-mail adress and fields for selecting and repeating password. 
After, the user clicks submit and will arrive to the browsing page.
In this fase, it is free to use the site but third party advertisments and fees could be implimented in the future.

## How to use SOOQ as an exsisting user

The user clicks on "Sign in" on the landing page.
The user will be asked for an exsisting username and matching password to the accoount.
The user will be redirected to the browsing page upon entering the right information,
If wrong information is typed in, the user may not sign in. An error mnessage will appear telling the user either the username or password are incorrect.

All the buttons frequently used buttons are placed in th e panel at the top. A red line highlights the panel.
The panel doesn't follow the page as the user scrolls down/up.
At the bottom of every page, the "About" section is placed.
It is darker as to diffrentiate that section and highlight that the end of the page has been reached.

The clickable links under "Menu" are vivid as to highlight the clickability.

## Testing

- I have manually tested the project by following these steps:
-  Clicked on the images, ads, buttons, links and categories.
-  Made sure that a new item can be listed, edited and removed.
-  Made sure that the admin-page tells me a new message has ben reveived by a "user".
-  Check if an item listed shows the correct price, description, category and images.
-  Newest items should be sent to the top of the "Dashboard" or landing page.
-  Related items should be suggested from the same/similar cetagories. (The Teddy has the Toy Car as a related item)
